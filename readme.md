- A Readme file containing documentation explaining how to run your project, how to interact with the API, your architectural decisions, any assumptions made, and any other necessary instructions.

> > How to run the code.
> > Steps :

1. Clone the project from github repository
2. run npm install
3. Add the ".env" file (added in .gitignore) with MONGO_URI and DB_PASSWORD (I'll send you if needed)
4. Run command "node app.js" in project directory in CMD
5. Hit the APIs using postman (I'll share my postman workspace through email)

> > Join my postman workspace (why?):
> > -- Every apis is documented well with proper examples and responses.
> > -- You don't need to give much time in reading codes.

> > Coding Architecture :
> > I used MVC coding architecture in this e-commerce project.

> > Assumptions :
> > Variant data is given along with product data while product creation. CRUD on variants can also be done using the product APIs.

> > Postman collection
> > I will send my postman invite link with the email.
